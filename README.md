Tools for mocking REST APIs for front-end development and testing

## Subject:

When it comes to mocking APIs for front-end development & testing, there are two main approaches you can consider:

1. Server-Side Mocking.
2. **Client-Side Mocking**
   - Tools: (MirageJS, MSW, JSON Server, etc…)
   - Manual Mocking: (writing mock data / functions in a file and importing it in the test file)

Goal ==> Explore different tools for mocking REST APIs for front-end development and testing.

## Note:

This project is a benchmark of different tools and technologies for mocking REST APIs.

**Tested tools and technologies include (branch by tool):**

- [Mirage JS](https://miragejs.com/)
- [MSW](https://mswjs.io/)
- [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
- [fetch-mock](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/fetch-mock/)
- [nock](https://github.com/nock/nock)
- [superagent](https://ladjs.github.io/superagent/)

> Other tools that may be tested in the future include:

- [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/)
- [WireMock](http://wiremock.org/)
- [MockServer](https://www.mock-server.com/)

Tools and technologies used in this project are not necessarily recommended for production use.
